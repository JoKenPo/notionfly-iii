  <h1 align="center">Notionfly III</h1>

The idea of this open source project is to "make" a [Firefly III](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/) using Notion as a database, thus leaving a completely free system, without the need to host.

## How to use

This is the [template](https://jokenp0.notion.site/Notionfly-27e7343b959746ee90a507e5dea5c599?pvs=4) for the bases that are used within Notion.
To use it, you must:

- Duplicate this template;
- Get the [id of this duplicated database](https://developers.notion.com/reference/retrieve-a-database#:~:text=To%20find%20a%20database%20ID,applicable)%20and%20the%20question%20mark.) within your Notion workspace;
- And you will also need to [create a <b>secret_key</b> in Notion](https://www.notion.so/help/create-integrations-with-the-notion-api);

With these two IDs it will be possible to access your database and do magic with this application.

## Under Construction

The project is in its initial stages, but the idea of the APP is to create graphs of your expenses, similar to how it is done in Firefly III and also have the feature of reading bank notifications of expenses and inserting the data semi-automatically
